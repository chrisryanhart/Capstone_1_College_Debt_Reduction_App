**Notes on API Data**

* Cost and earnings data is limited to students that received federal loans
* In-state and public colleges are able to provide an adjusted net cost
* Out-of-state public colleges do not have data available; Accordingly, the out-of-state cost was calculated as the full tuition, with no reduction based on household income, plus all fees including room & board and books.
